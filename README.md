# C_Projects
## Description
### 1.libft    
Implementing a set of functions from the **libc**. Functions have the same prototypes and implement the same behaviors as the originals. Also comply
with the way they are defined in their man. The only difference is their names. It
will begin with the ’ft_’ prefix. For instance, strlen becomes ft_strlen.

### 2.get_next_line
This project is about programming a function that returns a line
read from a file descriptor using static variable. It is also structured to impliment on multiple files.
